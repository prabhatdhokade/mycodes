8. **✅ Configuration Management**
   - Environment-based configuration (.env)
   - Pydantic settings validation
   - Configurable weather thresholds
   - Database URL configuration
   - API key management

9. **✅ Logging & Monitoring**
   - Structured logging with file rotation
   - Health check endpoints
   - System status monitoring
   - Error tracking and reporting

### Bonus Features

10. **✅ Hot Topics System**
    - Social media trending analysis
    - Engagement scoring algorithm: `(likes*2 + views*0.5 + comments*3)`
    - Redis-based caching (1-minute TTL)
    - Category-based trending analysis
    - 100 mock posts across 12 categories
